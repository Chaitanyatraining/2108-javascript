    <!-- 
        the 4 prinicples of oops
            - abstraction - ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, 
                        allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing.

            - Encapsulation - keeping properties and methods private inside the class
                as they are not accessible form outside the class.
            - inheritance - making all properies and methods of a certain class avaiable to a child class,
                formatting a hierarchical relationship between classes.
            - polymorphism - a child class can overwrite a method inherited fron a 
                parent class.
